Basics
---

### 0. No title
Simplest application written in white_gold:
#[sample/basics/step_0.rb]
When library is loaded this way, window is shown on script end.

### 1. Hello world
Let's customize window title:
#[sample/basics/step_1.rb]
Methods with trailing '!' are quiet common in white_gold. Generally, they are used to change the state of the currently running object.

### 2. Button
Widgets are also created by methods with bang:
#[sample/basics/step_2.rb]
Several named arguments can be passed with the widget creating method call. They will be used as the new widget attributes.

### 3. Widget tree
To build widget tree, call widget creating methods inside associated block:
#[sample/basics/step_3.rb]
Providing an array as position attribute allows to set x and y coordinates individually. 
When rational is used as position argument, then it is interpreted as relative to the parent size.

### 4. Callbacks
In associated blocks attributes can be adapted, too:
#[sample/basics/step_4.rb]
`on_press!` can be called multiple times, every time new signal listener is attached. The block given as the argument is evaluated when the button is pressed.

### 5. Themes
Theme defines how widgets looks like. `theme!` method allows to set up global theme for all widgets. There is also `renderer!` method to make widget special look:
#[sample/basics/step_5.rb]

### 6. Custom widgets
List of base widgets with methods to create them can be found [here](./api). 
Custom widgets can be created by customizing and combining base widgets:
#[sample/basics/step_6.rb]
Notice, that methods are not defined in common way (`def! :hello_world` instead of `def hello_world!`).

DSL
---

### Abstract bang stack:<br>

Allows to simulate local block call context. Convenient and flexible way for building tree like structures.

#[sample/dsl/abs_1.rb]

Output:<br>
<img src="../../.github/img/screen_3.PNG">

The abstract bang stack is based on method_missing mechanism, so lexical scope is not overwritten. 'self' left unchanged. 
Instance methods and variables are available directly:

#[sample/dsl/abs_2.rb]

Defining methods witch '!' at the end should be avoided, because its breaks method_missing redirecting.
To define new bang callable method, use 'def!':

#[sample/dsl/abs_3.rb]

When top bang call stack target doesn't respond to bang method, then method is redirected to the target below.

#[sample/dsl/abs_4.rb]

For convenience also setters are callable in bang form:

#[sample/dsl/abs_5.rb]

### Widgets attributing:<br>

Almost every widget is created empty. Attribute setting is invoked on existing instance:

#[sample/dsl/attributing/attr_1.rb]

There are two other ways for setting attributes. First one uses bang calls (described in details in previous paragraph):

#[sample/dsl/attributing/attr_2.rb]

Second one is passing attributes as named arguments:

#[sample/dsl/attributing/attr_3.rb]

With the help of the 'upon!' method, these methods can also be used after initialization:

#[sample/dsl/attributing/attr_4.rb]

### Method to proc conversion:<br>

To convert method to proc, prefix it with 'proc.':

#[sample/dsl/proc/proc_1.rb]

#[sample/dsl/proc/proc_2.rb]

API
---
_Due to the heavy use of metaprogramming, the documentation generated by tools like rdoc can be confusing._

Methods prefixed with `api_`, `abi_`, `self_`, `_abi_` belongs to the internal API and shouldn't be used directly.<br>
Generated API reference: [Widgets API](./api)
